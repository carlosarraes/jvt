# Java

Learning java, nothing to see here :)

## Classes, Object & Methods

1. Create a new Java project and try modeling a domain you’re comfortable with. It could be
   something like: Sports, Business, Mathematics, Online Shopping, etc. For example, if you
   modeled online shopping, you might create classes to represent: Customer, Product, Order,
   etc. These classes would likely have properties and you may think of a few methods that
   might make sense for them too. There is no example code for this.
2. Create an array and initialize it with the days of the week.
   2.1.Use System.out.println() to print:
   2.1.1.The number
   2.1.2.The 4th day in the array
3. Create an array and initialize it with numbers, 1-10.
4. Try creating an array to represent the tic-tac-toe board to the right.
   4.1.How would you access the value in the bottom right square with
   Java code?
5. Write a method that allows you to pass any number of Strings as parameter inputs without
   using an array.
6. How can you create a method that can be called without creating an instance of its class?
7. Model a Car, create an instance of it, pass it to System.out.println() so that its properties will
   be printed.
8. Model a Bank with the ability to access the vault. Model a BankManager and a Customer
   too. Ensure the Customer can not access the Bank’s vault directly but the BankManager
   can.
9. How can you ensure that a Customer instance can not be created without a name and an
   initial deposit?
10. How might you model a Math class to know about Euler’s number?
11. Model a class with data that enumerates (associates with a number) the first names of three
    friends, classmates or coworkers. Make it so that this name data will be shared among all
    instances of the class. of items in the array
